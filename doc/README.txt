-> CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY:

README.txt   This file.

epydocrc     Configuration file for generating API documentation
	     using epydoc.  An example use of that file is the
	     following command line command:

             epydoc-py24 --config epydocrc /Users/jlin/work/lib/otherpy/qtcm

	     where [...]/qtcm argument is the directory to the
	     source code of the package.

./html       HTML version of the manual.  Generated from the LaTeX
	     version using latex2html.

./html-api   HTML form of API documentation.  Generated by epydoc.

index.html   Redirect to ./html/index.html.

./latex      LaTeX version of the manual.

make_docs    Bash script to use pdfLaTeX, LaTeX2HTML, and epydoc
	     to create the PDF and HTML versions of the documentation.
	     In Unix, type:

             $ make_docs

             This script deletes the previous version of the HTML
             version as well as overwrites the previous version of
             the PDF version.  THIS SCRIPT IS CUSTOMIZED FOR MY OWN
             COMPUTER, SO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND YOU USE IT WITHOUT
             FIRST GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT
             YOU'RE DOING.

manual.pdf   PDF version of the manual.  Generated from the LaTeX
             version.
