General notes of things I think I may have observed about
\code{Parameters} objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can treat a \code{Parameters} instance as a dictionary, where
	the key is the name of the field, because \code{\_\_getitem\_\_},
	etc.\ have been defined for the instance.  However, the values,
	units, and long names of the fields are stored in dictionaries
	assigned to \code{value}, \code{units}, and \code{long\_name},
	keyed to the field name (a string).
\end{itemize}


General notes of things I think I may have observed about
\code{Components} objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item All variables and quantities, whether they be physical fields,
	filenames, or metadata,
	are stored as attributes in the \code{Components} instance.
\item \code{Components} have these special attributes:
        \code{Required},
        \code{Prognostic},
	and
        \code{Diagnostic},
	which are lists that contain the names of describe whether
\item Scalar parameters in \code{Component} objects
	are stored as an instance of the \code{Parameters}
	class, under the attribute \code{Params}.
\end{itemize}


General notes of things I think I may have observed about
\code{Federation} objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{Federation} objects hold the \code{Components} instances
	in a list assigned to the attribute \code{list}.
\item \code{Federation} attributes
        \code{Required},
        and
	\code{Prognostic},
	are unions of the same attributes of the constituent
	\code{Components} objects.
\end{itemize}
