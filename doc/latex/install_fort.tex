You must have a Fortran compiler installed on your system in order
to compile \mods{qtcm}.  The compiler must be able to interface with
a pre-processor, as QTCM1 makes copious use of pre-processor directives.
\mods{qtcm} is known to work with the following Fortran compilers on the
following platforms:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
\textbf{Compiler}  & \textbf{Compiler Web Site} & \textbf{Platform(s)} \\ 
\hline
\mods{g95} & \htmladdnormallink{http://www.g95.org/}{http://www.g95.org/}  
	& Mac OS X \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It will probably work with other platforms, but I haven't been able
to test platforms besides those listed above.  Note that \mods{g95}
is not \htmladdnormallink{GNU Fortran}{http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/}
(\mods{gfortran}), the Fortran 95 compiler included with the more
recent versions of GCC.
